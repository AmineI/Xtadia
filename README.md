Xtadia
========

Xtadia is a Xposed module that allows to play Stadia games on any phones and any connection type.

It workarounds the ~~current~~ limitation of needing a Pixel phone and a WiFi network, by simulating exactly that to the Stadia app.

Be warned that it was limited for a reason, and you may not have an optimal experience at the moment by using an untested connection/configuration.

September Update : 
------

This limitation is no more, thus making this module unneeded : One can now go into the "Experiments" menu, in the Stadia app, to enable both playing on unsupported phones and cellular connections.  Happy gaming :) !

I'll leave this source and module online. As it was my first public Xposed Module, I learned a lot while making it !
