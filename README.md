Xtadia
========

Xtadia is a Xposed module that allows to play Stadia games on any phones and any connection type.

It workarounds the current limitation of needing a Pixel phone and a WiFi network, by simulating exactly that to the Stadia app.

Be warned that it was limited for a reason, and you may not have an optimal experience at the moment by using an untested connection/configuration.
